      <h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>
        Morgorath, Lord of the Mountains of Rain and Night, former Baron of Gorlan in the kingdom Araluen, looked out over his bleak, rainswept domain, and, for perhaps the thousandth time, cursed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was all that was left to him now- a jumble of rugged granite cliffs, tumbled boulders and icy mountains. Of sheer gorges and steep narrow passes. Of gravel and rock, with never a tree or sign of green to break the monotony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it had been fifteen years since he had been driven back into this forbidding realm that had become his prison, he could still remember the pleasant green glades and thickly forrested hills of former fief. The streams filled with fish, and the fields rich with crops and game. Gorlan had been a beautiful, living place. The Mountains of Rain and Night were dead and desolate.
      </p>
      <p>
        A platoon of Wargals was drilling in the castle yard below him. Morgorath watched them for a few seconds, listening to the gutteral, rhythmic chant that accompanied all their movements. They were stocky, mishapen beings, with features that were halfway human, but with a long, brutish muzzle and fangs like a bear or a large dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoiding all contact with humans, the Wargals had lived and bred in these remote mountains since ancient times. Noone in living memory had ever set eyes upon one, but rumours had persisted, of a savage tribe of semi-intelligent beasts in the mountains. Morgorath, planning a revoult against the Kingdom of Araluen, had left Gorlan Fief to seek them out. If such creatures existed, they would give him an edge in the war that was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took him months, but he eventually found them. Aside from their wordless chant, Wargals had no spoken language, relying on a primitive form of thought awareness for communication.
